        - Oversaw the deployment of a hyperscalable MES system in the Austin
        factory. I worked on call to mitigate problems, deploy hotfixes and
        mitigate problems
        
        - Designed integration layer between several systems, utilizing kafka
        and gRPC to ensure the seemless hand off of data to downstream systems
        
        - Interfaced with customers to quickly implement peripheral software to
        satisfy immediate customer needs, later building more robust solutions
        
        - Developed new APIs with gRPC + protobufs

        - Spearheaded efforts to intergrate event sourced systems with other
        transactional systems, created extensive monitoring and dashboards to
        monitor systems that allowed users to see volume and material shipments
        problems at a glance
        
        - Integration work between event sourced systems and regular monoliths.
        Insured seemless data flow and synchronized state. Mostly synchronizing
        orders, quality and material flow. 
        
        - Worked among multiple teams and with customers to develope UIs in
        ReacJS and Typescript for lineside associates to interface with downtime
        reporting systems
        
        - Developed various dashboards for tracking trailer shipments and
        automatic guided verhicles on maps.

      summary:
        Responsible for spearheading the development of a versatile platform to
        visualize real-time streaming production data, collaborating with a team
        to design and implement frontend and backend components. Led
        the development lifecycle, including architecture design and feature
        prioritization, culminating in the delivery of a platform enabling clients
        to configure 3D renderings of manufacturing sites with live production and
        geospatial data integration.
      description:
        - tasked with creating a general purpose platform for visually
        displaying live streaming production data, I worked with various
        individuals to architect both frontend and backend portions of the
        platform. I lead development, architecture and feature planning, creating a platform
        that allowed customers to setup 3D representations of manufacturing
        locations with live production and location data
        - spearheaded and prioritized various customer requirements and asks
        - architected frontend and backend and lead development of a streaming visualization project
        that shipped realtime production data to clients built with React and
        ThreeJS
        - monorepo project with many services
        - integrations with PLCs through OPCUA and Kafka, other system reporting DBs with SQL 
        - built extensive feature sets such as in-app environment editors, 3D
        collision algorithms (BVH + SA Hueristic), streaming architecture, Oauth
        authentication, authorization, various GPU optimizations

        - Developed a REST and Websocket streaming APIs for interfacing with frontend. 

        - Generalized bespoke business logic by fanning out data streaming,
        decoupling data model from data models of other systems 
        
        - architected and implemented a robust streaming architecture based on
        Postgres Listen/Notify and websockets in a Golang service
        
        - architected a component relational model that allowed the flexibility
        
        - developed robust streaming architecture for third party data
        
        - Built an in app editor for manipulating and building 3D environments
        with various tools for creating, placing and adjusting model meshes.
        
        - Implemented 3D algorithms for O(log(n)) broadphase collision detection
        (BVH + SAH rotation), increasing max mesh count by 20,000%.
        
        - Developed shared abstractions such that other newer developers could
        build new features without in depth 3D programming knowledge
        
        - Introduced various GPU optimizations such as mesh instancing and
        shader adjustments for performance and visual improvements
        
        - implemented Oauth authentication flows and RBAC authorization
        middlewares
        
        - extensive work developing 3D algorithms
        
        - developed state management strategies for our browser UI using
        reducers, zustand stores and apis for interfacing with ThreeJS state
        
        - general project ownership like integration test suites, database
        migration strategies and dev tooling, CI/CD with Jenkins and GHA,
        releases, automated deplyments to k8s and semantic versioning
        
        - worked with various customers to determine needs to develope new
        feature requirements and architecture

        - Golang codegen

        - Mentored colleagues to contribute to the project and performed extensive code reviews

        - ran various tech talks for exposure and customer demos and training


In a resume, what do I want to see? 
- I do want to see leadership, proactiveness, and collaboritiveness. (In the interview is where I want to hear about introspection)
- But what will catch my eye at first is talking about the developmental efforts
- On the technical side, scalability
