      position: Senior Software Engineer
      location: Austin, Tx
      summary: >
        Lead the development of a general purpose digital-twin
        platform to visualize real-time production data, collaborating
        with a team to design and implement frontend and backend components. Led
        the development lifecycle, including architecture design and feature
        prioritization, culminating in the delivery of a platform enabling clients
        to configure 3D renderings of manufacturing sites with live production and
        geospatial data integration.

      highlights: 

      - Platform enabled customers to build digital twins of production areas by providing live streamed production data to be bound to custom geospatial environments that could be built in-app. 

      - Led the planning and development for both frontend and backend services, utilizing Postgres (SQL) for persistance and streaming (LISTEN/NOTIFY + Websocket), Golang for backend services, middleware and Websocket + REST APIs, and ReactJS + Typescript paired with ThreeJS for primary UI functions

      - Implemented extensive design and optimizations for 3D environments, including an algorithm for O(log(n)) broadphase collision detection (BVH + SAH rotation), increasing max mesh count by 20,000% compared to other solutions

      - Designed middleware for Oauth flows in the frontend and backend, utilizing Azure for authentication and a proprietary OPAL solution for RBAC authorization

      - Designed a general component relational data model for tracking components in a geospatial, 3D environment that utilized json-schema for parameter validation. This enabled flexible approach ...

      - Implemented REST and Websocket API along with middleware for Oauth authentication (azure), authorization RBAC (proprietary OPAL solution) 

      - Collaborated with a small team to run extensive architecture and UI design sessions, create development plans and project roadmaps

      - Mentored interns and other engineers to contribute

      - Managed all aspects of the project development, including automation tooling (codegen, db migrations, testing), monorepo services structure, integration test suites (testify, playwright), quality assurance, and deployment with Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins

      - Spearheaded adoption of the platform throughout the company by running tech talks, customer and director demos and working directly with customers to evaluate features and designs

      highlights:

      - Built gRPC and Kafka APIs and features to integrate data model of an Event Sourced MES application with various transactional systems. Efforts involved designing integration flows and developing new gRPC + protobuf APIs, Kafka Consumers and publishers, resulting consistency of quality and build data in downstream and upstream systems.

      - Worked with multiple teams and customers to develope backend and UI features using Golang, ReactJS and Typescript for lineside associates to interface with downtime reporting systems

      - Developed multiple React, ThreeJS and SVG (d3) dashboards for tracking trailer shipments and automated guided vehicle live location on maps that displayed various KPIs with livestreamed data

      - Lead cross team efforts to diagnose various issues in Tesla's technical infrastructure that affected our apps, including identifying a TCP MTU size misconfiguration between external and in-cluster load balancers that caused arbitrary dropped packets in commucation over gRPC APIs. 

      - Built golang CLI tools that interfaced with our gRPC APIs for our support engineers to use to satisfy many bulk data tasks and ran training sessions

      - Developed various features in a proprietary protocol that enabled PLCs to automatically control lineside systems and update build models/statuses

      - Instrumented apps with metrics and logs, built monitoring dashboards in Grafana and Splunk to monitor the health of our apps

      - Maintained a business first mentality. In an era of extreme scale, this meant  

      - Interfaced directly with customers to quickly iterate on new features as rapidly as possible

      - Participated in on-call rotations, swiftly diagnosing issues, deploying hotfixes, and rectifying data discrepancies in production environments to minimize downtime and ensure uninterrupted service delivery.

      highlights:
      - Led architectural overhaul of core gateway golang service, implementing a micro-kernel architecture drastically improving development cycle time by minimizing technical debt and increased throughput performance by more than 3x.
      - Identified gaps in cloud telemetry data gathered; developed OpenStack API and container stat monitoring agents in Python and Golang such as the collectd-libpod-stats plugin
      - Standardized metrics and event reporting data model for the telemetry framework and built standardized dashboards with Grafana, Prometheus and Elasticsearch to provide customers out of box cloud monitoring dashboards
      - Increased team efficiency by building out automation tooling for release processes in Python and onboarding new engineers to team processes
      - Advanced Red Hat open source influence by working with upstream open source communities including CentOS, RHEL and RDO to package and release updates and packages as RPMs and Docker images 
      - Provided technical support for consultants and customers using the Service Telemetry Framework
