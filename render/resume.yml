    summary: "Led the full stack development of a general purpose 3D digital-twin visualization platform. Managed the full project lifecycle, from architecture design to feature prioritization, resulting in a configurable, site agnostic platform that enabled customers to build 3D virtual representations of production areas and bind live-streamed production data to virtual assets\n"
    highlights:
      - 'Led the planning and development for both frontend and backend services, utilizing Postgres (SQL) for persistence and streaming (Listen/Notify + Websocket), Golang for backend services, middleware and Websocket + REST APIs, and ReactJS + Typescript paired with ThreeJS for primary UI functions'
      - 'Planned and implemented an in-app environment editor, allowing users to build visualizations in the web browser. Implemented extensive feature sets in Golang, ReactJS, Typescript and ThreeJS involving complex state management in the frontend and backend, 3D algorithms and GPU optimizations'
      - 'Architected a general component relational data model for tracking components in a spacial environment that utilized json-schema for parameter validation'
      - 'Implemented extensive design and optimizations for 3D environments, including an algorithm for O(log(n)) broad phase collision detection (BVH + SAH rotation), increasing max mesh count by 20,000% compared to other open source solutions'
      - 'Collaborated with a team to run extensive architecture and UI design sessions, create development plans and project roadmaps. Mentored engineers and interns to onboard and contribute quickly.'
      - 'Built middleware for Oauth (OpenID) flows in the frontend and backend, utilizing Azure IAM for authentication and a proprietary OPAL solution for RBAC authorization'
      - 'Setup project backend, frontend project scaffolding and building blocks such as dependency injection patterns, config patterns, streaming, state management, 3D primitives, etc to ease developer onboarding and project maintenance'
      - 'Integrated data streams from various external systems including Airflow, OPCUA (PLCs), application reporting DBs and Kafka topics'
      - 'Managed all aspects of the project development, including automation tooling (codegen, db migrations, testing), mono repo services structure, integration test suites (testify, playwright), quality assurance, and deployment with Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins'
